python app.py
```

With GM password protection:
```bash
python app.py --password your_secret_password
```

- **GM Interface**: http://localhost:5000/gm
- **Player Interface**: Use the Links feature to generate player URLs

## How to Use

### Getting Started

1. **Start the server** with `python app.py`
2. **Open the GM interface** at http://localhost:5000/gm
3. **Create a new storyline** by clicking "+ New"
4. **Add injects** to your storyline using the "+ Add Inject" card
5. **Activate the storyline** by selecting it and clicking "Activate"
6. **Generate player links** via "🔗 Links" button
7. **Share player links** with your players

### Creating Storylines

1. Click **"+ New"** in the control bar
2. Enter a name for your storyline
3. Click **"Create"**

### Adding Injects

Injects are the individual story beats shown to players.

1. Click the **"+ Add Inject"** card in the storyline
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Heading**: Short title (shown prominently to players)
   - **Text**: Main content/description
   - **GM Notes**: Private notes only you can see
   - **Duration**: Auto-advance time in seconds (0 = manual only)
   - **Day**: Optional day number (0 = hidden, 1+ shows as "Day 1", "Day 2", etc.)
   - **Time**: Optional time in HH:MM format (empty = hidden)
   - **Image**: Optional image upload
   - **Target Player Types**: Limit which players see this inject
3. Click **"Save Inject"**

**Day and Time** are displayed to players above the inject heading in orange text, useful for showing story progression (e.g., "Day 1 — 09:00").

### Managing Branches

Branches allow side quests or alternate paths that diverge from the main storyline.

1. Click the **⑂ branch button** on any inject
2. Configure the branch:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name for the branch
   - **Auto-trigger**: Automatically starts when parent inject is reached
   - **Manual trigger**: GM must activate it manually
   - **Merge target**: Where to resume the main storyline after branch completes
3. Add injects to the branch

**Branch Rules:**
- An inject can have ONE auto-trigger branch OR multiple manual branches
- If an inject has an auto-trigger branch, no additional branches can be added
- Multiple manual branches on the same inject allow GM choice during play

### Player Types

Target specific content to specific players.

1. Click **"👥 Types"** to manage player types
2. Add types like "Wizard", "Knight", "Ranger"
3. When creating injects, select which types should see it
4. Players using type-specific links only see relevant content
5. The "All Players" link sees everything
6. **Silent targeting**: Players see no refresh or indication when an inject not meant for them is played

### Player Links

1. Click **"🔗 Links"** to open the links panel
2. Click **"Generate Links"** to create URLs
3. Share type-specific links with players, or use the "All Players" link
4. **Regenerate** creates new URLs (old links stop working)

### Session Notes

The **Notes for Later** panel lets you capture observations during play.

1. Type a note in the text area
2. Press **Enter** to submit (or **Alt+Enter** for line breaks)
3. Notes are saved with:
   - **Timestamp** - When the note was created
   - **Inject reference** - Which inject was active (e.g., "#4-2 Secret Cave" for branch inject 2 on main inject 4)
4. **Export** notes to a text file for post-session review
5. **Clear All** to reset notes for a new session

Session notes are stored separately from storyline data and persist across browser refreshes.

### Session Clocks

Two digital clocks are displayed next to the navigation buttons:

- **Current Time** - Shows the current time (HH:MM:SS)
- **Session Stopwatch** - Starts when you first advance the storyline, resets when you click Reset

The stopwatch helps track session duration without needing an external timer.

### Inject Preview

Hover over any inject card (in the storyline, branches, or library) to see a preview popup showing:

- **Day/Time** - If set for the inject
- **Heading** - The inject title
- **Image** - Thumbnail if an image is attached
- **Text** - The player-visible content
- **GM Notes** - Your private notes (shown in orange)

The preview appears after 700ms of hovering and follows your cursor.

### Running a Session

#### Manual Control
- Use **"◀ Prev"** and **"Next ▶"** buttons to navigate
- Click inject **numbers** to jump directly (works for both main storyline and branch injects)
- Use **keyboard shortcuts**: ← → or Page Up/Down

#### Auto-Play
- Click the **▶ Play button** to start auto-playback
- Injects with durations will auto-advance
- Injects with 0 duration pause until you click Next
- Click **⏸** to pause

#### Branches
- **Auto-trigger branches** activate automatically when you reach their parent inject
- **Manual branches** must be activated by clicking **"▶ Start"** on the branch
- Active branches show with highlighted borders
- Click **"⏹ Stop"** to deactivate a branch - the current inject stays visible to players
- When you click **"Next"** after stopping a branch, playback returns to the main storyline
- When a branch completes naturally, playback returns to the main storyline (or merge target)

#### Branch Controls
- **▶ Start**: Activate the branch (players won't see any change until you advance)
- **⏹ Stop**: Deactivate the branch (players continue seeing current inject until you advance)
- Activating/deactivating branches does NOT refresh the player view - only advancing does

### Zoom Controls

The storyline view supports zooming for better overview:

- **+ / -** buttons or keyboard shortcuts to zoom in/out
- **⊙** button or **0** key to reset to 100%
- **⊡** button or **F** key to auto-fit all injects in view

## Tips for Game Masters

1. **Prepare in advance**: Build your storyline before the session
2. **Use GM notes**: Add reminders, questions to ask, or dice roll instructions
3. **Set strategic durations**: Use auto-advance for atmospheric moments, manual for decision points
4. **Create branches for flexibility**: Have side content ready if players go off-script
5. **Use manual branches for choices**: Create multiple manual branches on a decision point inject to give players options
6. **Use merge targets strategically**: Skip ahead in the main storyline after a branch to avoid repetition
7. **Use player types wisely**: Give each player type their moment to shine
8. **Test player links**: Verify links work before the session
9. **Keep a library**: Save reusable elements like tavern descriptions or combat encounters
10. **Branch controls are invisible to players**: Starting/stopping branches won't alert players - only advancing does
11. **Use Day/Time for pacing**: Show story progression with day numbers and timestamps at key moments
12. **Generate with AI**: Use the included `prompt.txt` with ChatGPT to generate complete storylines
13. **Take session notes**: Use the Notes for Later panel to capture observations for post-session review
14. **Export notes after sessions**: Download your session notes before clearing for the next session
15. **Use zoom to fit**: Press F to auto-zoom so all injects are visible at once
16. **Hover to preview**: Hover over any inject to quickly see its content without opening the editor
17. **Track session time**: The stopwatch starts automatically when you advance - use it to pace your session
