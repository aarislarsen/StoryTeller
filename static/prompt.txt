Prompt for ChatGPT to Generate StoryTeller Adventures
=====================================================

I need you to create a JSON data file for a storytelling application called StoryTeller. This application is used by a Game Master (GM) to guide players through an interactive story with visual injects (story beats) that appear on player screens.

**Create a Dungeons & Dragons-style fairytale adventure suitable for children aged 6-8.** The story should be magical, whimsical, and age-appropriate with themes of friendship, courage, and helping others. No scary monsters or violence - keep it light and fun.

**The JSON structure must follow this exact format:**

```json
{
  "storylines": {
    "STORYLINE_UUID": {
      "name": "Story Title",
      "blocks": [
        {
          "id": "UNIQUE_UUID",
          "heading": "Short title shown to players",
          "text": "The story text shown to players (2-4 sentences, simple language)",
          "gm_notes": "Private notes for the GM with tips, questions to ask players, or actions to take",
          "duration": 0,
          "day": 1,
          "time": "09:00",
          "target_player_types": [],
          "image": null
        }
      ],
      "branches": [
        {
          "id": "BRANCH_UUID",
          "name": "Branch Name",
          "parent_inject_id": "ID of the inject this branches from",
          "auto_trigger": false,
          "merge_to_inject_id": "ID of inject to resume at after branch, or null",
          "current_inject": 0,
          "injects": [
            {
              "id": "UNIQUE_UUID",
              "heading": "Branch inject title",
              "text": "Branch story text",
              "gm_notes": "GM notes for this branch inject",
              "duration": 0,
              "day": 1,
              "time": "10:30",
              "target_player_types": [],
              "image": null
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "current_block": 0,
      "active_branches": []
    }
  },
  "active_storyline": null,
  "player_types": ["Knight", "Wizard", "Ranger"],
  "player_links": {},
  "generic_player_link": null,
  "inject_library": []
}
```

**Requirements:**

1. **Main storyline:** Create 12-15 injects telling a complete fairytale adventure (beginning, middle, end)

2. **Day and Time fields:** Use the `day` and `time` fields to show story progression:
   - `day`: Integer (0 = hidden, 1+ displays as "Day 1", "Day 2", etc.)
   - `time`: String in "HH:MM" format (empty string = hidden)
   - Use these to show the passage of time in your story (e.g., morning quest start, afternoon adventure, evening celebration)
   - Not every inject needs day/time - use them at key story moments

3. **Player types:** Use three player types: "Knight", "Wizard", and "Ranger" - occasionally use `target_player_types` to send specific injects to specific players (e.g., `["Wizard"]` for a magic-related moment, `["Knight"]` for a bravery moment)

4. **Branches for player choices:** Create 4-5 manual branches (`"auto_trigger": false`) that represent meaningful choices players can make:
   - At decision points in the story, create 2-3 branches on the same inject representing different choices (e.g., "Take the forest path", "Take the mountain path", "Take the river path")
   - Each choice branch should have 2-4 injects showing the consequences of that choice
   - Some branches should use `merge_to_inject_id` to skip ahead in the main storyline (e.g., a shortcut that bypasses some encounters)
   - Some branches should merge back to the next sequential inject (set `merge_to_inject_id` to null or the next inject)
   - Make choices meaningful but all lead to a happy ending

5. **Branch rules to follow:**
   - All branches must be manual (`"auto_trigger": false`) since multiple branches will be attached to the same inject
   - An inject can only have ONE auto-trigger branch, OR multiple manual branches - never both
   - Use manual branches for all choice points

6. **Example choice structure:**
   - Inject #5: "You reach a crossroads. Three paths lie before you."
   - Branch A (parent: #5): "The Sunny Meadow Path" - 2 injects, merges to #8
   - Branch B (parent: #5): "The Whispering Woods Path" - 3 injects, merges to #8  
   - Branch C (parent: #5): "The Stepping Stones Path" - 2 injects, merges to #10 (skips ahead!)

7. **Durations:** 
   - Set `"duration": 0` for most injects (GM advances manually)
   - Set `"duration": 20` or `"duration": 30` for a few atmospheric moments where auto-advance fits

8. **GM Notes:** Include helpful GM notes with:
   - Questions to ask the players ("Ask the children which path looks most exciting!")
   - Actions ("Have players vote on which choice to take")
   - Dice rolls ("Roll a D6 - on 4+, they find a shiny coin!")
   - Tips ("This is a good moment for a snack break")
   - Choice guidance ("If players can't decide, suggest the Meadow Path for younger groups")

9. **Story elements to include:**
   - A clear quest or goal established early
   - Friendly magical creatures (talking animals, friendly fairies, helpful sprites)
   - 2-3 meaningful choice points where players decide the path
   - Moments where each player type gets to shine
   - Consequences that feel different but all lead to success
   - A happy, satisfying ending that references choices made
   - Age-appropriate humor and wonder

10. **UUIDs:** Generate valid UUIDs for all `id` fields (format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

11. **Language:** Use simple vocabulary and short sentences appropriate for 6-8 year olds being read to

**Example choice point with branches:**

Main inject #6 might be: "The fairy asks: 'How will you help wake the sleeping dragon?'"

Then create three branches all with `parent_inject_id` pointing to inject #6:
- "Sing a Gentle Song" branch (3 injects) → merges to inject #9
- "Tickle His Nose" branch (2 injects) → merges to inject #9
- "Find His Teddy Bear" branch (4 injects) → merges to inject #11 (longer path skips past an encounter)

**Example day/time usage:**

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "heading": "A New Day Dawns",
  "text": "The sun rises over the Enchanted Forest. Birds sing their morning songs.",
  "day": 1,
  "time": "07:00",
  ...
}
```

Later in the story:
```json
{
  "id": "...", 
  "heading": "The Victory Feast",
  "text": "As the sun sets, the village celebrates your brave deeds!",
  "day": 1,
  "time": "18:00",
  ...
}
```

For a multi-day adventure:
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "heading": "Camp Under the Stars", 
  "text": "You rest by the campfire, dreaming of tomorrow's adventure.",
  "day": 1,
  "time": "21:00",
  ...
}
```

Then the next morning:
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "heading": "The Journey Continues",
  "text": "After a good night's sleep, you set off refreshed and ready!",
  "day": 2,
  "time": "08:00",
  ...
}
```

**Output only the JSON file with no additional explanation.**
